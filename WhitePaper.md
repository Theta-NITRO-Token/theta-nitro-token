## 1. Introduction Theta Nitro Token (TNT)

The first Theta meme token that actually has a value and is constantly growing in its TFuel value. Nitro is backed by TFuel and can always be redeemed to its current TFuel value at any time. The big advantage is that the TFuel amount which backs one Nitro Token can only increase and never decrease. Nitro aims for stable growth and offers a unique opportunity for investors by ensuring stable and reliable retention and a steady increase in value over time.

What will give investors the security to trust in the token? Trust is a key element which is why our token contract is audited and published. Theta Nitro Token prioritizes transparency and security, guaranteeing that the TFuel backing is secure and inaccessible. Only by burning Nitro you get the corresponding TFuel paid out.

Through Theta Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), the project fosters community engagement and inclusivity, providing an accessible entry point for users through OpenTheta, enhancing participation and involvement.

A simple method for calculating the TFuel-backed value per Theta Nitro Token increases transparency and makes it easy to understand (TFuel in the Contract / Total Circulating Supply of Nitro).


## 2. Problem Statement

In the Theta ecosystem, the lack of a meme token with inherent value and sustainable growth in TFuel undermines investor confidence. Existing tokens typically lack a reliable mechanism which leads to either highly volatile values and/or uncertain redemption processes. This volatility exposes investors to significant risk and undermines confidence in the token.  \
\
In addition, the lack of transparency and verifiability of token contracts raises concerns about potential vulnerabilities and unauthorized access to TFuel reserves. As a result, investors have no safe and reliable way to own a meme token and not run into a rug pull at a certain time. The Theta Nitro Token is therefore the first trustworthy meme token with reliable and secure benefits.


## 3. Solution and Tokenomics

The Nitro token represents a new kind of solution within the Theta network by introducing the first meme token with tangible value and continuous growth in TFuel.  \
Backed by TFuel reserves, Nitro offers all users a secure way to redeem their tokens at any time at their current TFuel value.

You may ask now how does the value of Nitro increase?

Initially through buying the Nitro NFT you are eligible for 5000 Nitro tokens which are valued in 500 Tfuel (10:1 ratio at launch). By using the NFT you do not need to pay any fees. If more people want to join Nitro at a later stage, there will always be options to do that but then there will be a fee applied which gets redistributed to all Nitro holders. This fee increases over time and benefits early-stage investors.

Secondly each time someone sends a Nitro token to a new wallet or trades it, there is a 2% fee applied which gets burned. This lowers the supply and with that increases the value of each Nitro token. Adding to that is the creator fee generated from trading Nitro NFTs on OpenTheta and of the Nitro liquidity pool on Theta Swap. \
\
Summary of the Nitro value generation:



1. NFT Trading Creator Fee 7% (Add)
2. Nitro token Transaction fee 2% (Burn)
3. Late buy in fee 1%-5% (Add)
4. Tfuel Staking from Contract (Added with Meme token V2)

In the following table you can see on which days the contracts allows you to mint new tokens and what the fee is. On the same days you can redeem your Nitro for TFuel with a 0% fee. On every other day redeeming is still possible but a 2% Fee will be deducted.

To continue in the same rhythm, the mint is closed after every 30 days and opened for one day.

## 4. Technology and Architecture

With the Nitro token smart contract on the Theta blockchain, we are using a self-executing digital contract that automatically enforces and executes the terms and conditions defined in its code. This contract is powered by Theta blockchain technology, ensuring transparency, security, and immutability. In addition, the Nitro NFTs on the Theta blockchain represent unique digital assets that are used to verify ownership for the no-fee Nitro Token distribution and for the redistribution of applicable fees to the holders.


## 5. Use Cases
1. Secure Investment Vehicle for investors who prioritize security and stable growth over speculative gains: Investors looking for a stable, secure digital asset can use the Nitro Token as a safe investment option. With its backing by TFuel, and an audited smart contract, Nitro Token offers a dependable store of value. Investors can redeem their tokens for the backed TFuel amount at any time, providing a fallback option in case they decide to liquidate their holdings. 

2. Community Engagement through NFTs to foster community engagement and inclusivity within the Theta ecosystem: Ownership of these NFTs not only grants users a certain amount of Nitro Token but also enhances their participation and involvement without entry fees. This creates a vibrant community around the project, driven by tangible benefits and shared interests.

3. Rewarding Early Adopters: Early-stage investors of Nitro Token benefit from lower fees and potentially higher rewards as the value of Nitro Token appreciates due to the fee structure and decreasing supply. This incentivizes early participation and investment in the token, creating a loyal user base that benefits from long-term value retention and growth.

4. Fee Generation Mechanism for Continuous Growth through a transaction fee model where a 2% fee is charged on transfers and trades. This fee is burned, effectively reducing the supply of Nitro Token and increasing the value of remaining tokens. This mechanism supports sustainable economic growth of the token by aligning the interests of long-term holders with the tokenomics of Nitro.

5. Enhanced Transparency and Trust: The straightforward method for calculating Nitro Tokenâ€™s value enhances transparency, making it easy for users to understand the worth of their investments at any point. Combined with the published and audited token contract, this builds trust among investors and users who seek clarity and security in their crypto transactions.

6. Enhanced Earnings through TFuel Staking: In the future evolution of the Nitro Token ecosystem, the introduction of a new version of the meme token contract (V2) featuring TFuel staking would allow users to earn passive income. By staking their TFuel in the Nitro V2 contract, users can secure additional earnings derived from the overall network activities and transaction fees. This staking mechanism not only incentivizes holding the tokens longer but also contributes to the stability and security of the network by locking in resources.

## 6. Roadmap
1. Smart Contract Audit
   - Ensure security and transparency through a comprehensive audit of the smart contract
3. NFT Drop
   - Release of 1000 NFTs, priced at 500 TFuel each
3. Launch Meme token contract
   - Allow NFT holders to redeem their NFTs for Theta Nitro Tokens
   - Create liquidity pool to facilitate smoother transactions and price stability
4. New buy in with fee follwoing the fee structure shown above
5. Launch Meme token contract V2 with TFuel Staking to provide additional earning mechanisms and increase network participation
